# Insta360-Drone-Mount
An Open Source Insta360 Drone Mount

Drones equipped with a 360 camera allow for a unique and immersive experience that can benefit both professionals and hobbyists alike. With a 360 camera, users are able to capture stunning visuals that were previously only achievable through expensive and complex equipment. By using an open source drone with a 360 camera, users can benefit from a wide range of features and capabilities, such as the ability to take high-quality aerial footage, live-streaming capabilities, and the ability to take panoramic images. Additionally, open source projects provide users with the freedom to customize their system and create their own unique experience.
